# torch-rnn
from https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn <br/>
torch-rnn provides high-performance, reusable RNN and LSTM modules for torch7, and uses these modules for character-level
language modeling similar to [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

You can find documentation for the RNN and LSTM modules [here](doc/modules.md); they have no dependencies other than `torch`
and `nn`, so they should be easy to integrate into existing projects.

Compared to char-rnn, torch-rnn is up to **1.9x faster** and uses up to **7x less memory**. For more details see 
the [Benchmark](#benchmarks) section below.
